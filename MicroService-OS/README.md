# MicroService OS

**A declarative terminal environment for the browser**  
*Extending DevTools philosophy to service orchestration and AI-native development*

---

## The DevTools Analogy

Just as Chrome DevTools is the **imperative debugger** for inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-time, **MicroService OS is the declarative orchestrator** for composing, managing, and debugging distributed logic.

| Chrome DevTools | MicroService OS |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inspect HTML elements | Inspect service configurations |
| Debug JavaScript execution | Debug rule-based logic flows |
| Monitor network requests | Monitor service communication |
| Live-edit CSS properties | Live-edit service specifications |
| Console for imperative commands | Terminal for declarative orchestration |
| Performance profiling | Service dependency analysis |

**Core Insight**: DevTools made web development accessible by providing visual tools for imperative code inspection. MicroService OS makes distributed systems development accessible by providing visual tools for declarative service composition.

## Architecture: Services as First-Class Citizens

### Service Definition Language
Services are defined as portable JSON/YAML specifications:

```json
{
  "id": "api-monitor",
  "type": "connector",
  "title": "API Health Monitor",
  "spec": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com/health",
    "interval": 30000,
    "outputKey": "health_data",
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "health_check",
        "if": "response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300",
        "then": {"status": "healthy", "alert": false}
      },
      {
        "name": "alert_condition", 
        "if": "response.status >= 500",
        "then": {"status": "critical", "alert": true}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Service Types

**Connectors** - API clients and data fetchers
```bash
spc> create connector bitcoin-price
spc> start bitcoin-price
spc> state bitcoin-price  # View fetched data
```

**Processors** - Data transformation pipelines  
```bash
spc> create processor price-analyzer
spc> link bitcoin-price -> price-analyzer  # Data flow
```

**Monitors** - Health checks and alerting
```bash
spc> create monitor system-health
spc> set system-health.thresholds.cpu 80%
```

**Interfaces** - Interactive forms and dashboards
```bash
spc> create interface roi-calculator
spc> expose roi-calculator  # Make publicly accessible
```

## The Terminal Interface

MicroService OS provides a Unix-like command environment for service management:

```bash
# List running services
spc> ps
SERVICES:
bitcoin-price    RUNNING   connector  Bitcoin Price Feed
price-analyzer   STOPPED   processor  Price Analysis Engine  
system-health    RUNNING   monitor    System Health Monitor

# Start/stop services
spc> start price-analyzer
spc> stop system-health

# Inspect service state
spc> state bitcoin-price
{
  "price": 65432.10,
  "change_24h": 2.34,
  "status": "healthy",
  "last_update": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

# View service logs
spc> logs bitcoin-price --tail 10

# Export system configuration
spc> export system.json
```

## Visual Service Composition

### Drag-and-Drop Orchestration
- Visual service dependency mapping
- Real-time data flow visualization  
- Point-and-click configuration editing
- Live preview of service outputs

### Embedded Dev Mode
Like "Inspect Element" but for services:
- Right-click any service → "Inspect Service"
- Live-edit JSON specifications
- Debug rule evaluation step-by-step
- Monitor inter-service communication

## AI-Native Design

### Natural Language to Service Specs
```
"Monitor Bitcoin price and send Slack alert if it drops below $50k"
     ↓ LLM Generation ↓
{
  "type": "connector",
  "spec": {
    "url": "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd",
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "price_alert",
        "if": "data.bitcoin.usd < 50000",
        "then": {"webhook": "slack://alerts", "message": "BTC below $50k!"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### LLM Service Generation
- **Natural language** → **JSON service specs**
- **Context-aware** service recommendations
- **Self-documenting** configurations
- **Collaborative** human-AI development workflows

## Use Cases

### Development Operations
```bash
# API monitoring dashboard
spc> create connector api-health
spc> create monitor uptime-tracker  
spc> create interface ops-dashboard
spc> link api-health -> uptime-tracker -> ops-dashboard
```

### Business Process Automation
```bash
# Customer onboarding pipeline  
spc> create connector crm-webhook
spc> create processor email-validator
spc> create interface welcome-form
spc> orchestrate onboarding-flow.yaml
```

### Personal Productivity
```bash
# Investment tracking system
spc> create connector portfolio-api
spc> create processor roi-calculator
spc> create monitor alert-engine
spc> schedule daily-update 09:00
```

## Integration with SPC Ecosystem

### PowerPoint++ Integration
Services can be embedded as interactive slides:
```json
{
  "slide_type": "service_dashboard",
  "services": ["bitcoin-price", "portfolio-tracker"],
  "layout": "grid_2x1"
}
```

### Single Page Computer Compatibility  
- Services run as portable SPC applications
- Export services as standalone HTML files
- Share service configurations via JSON/YAML
- Version control service specifications with Git

## Philosophy

**Services should be declarative.** Complex distributed behavior emerges from simple, composable service definitions rather than imperative orchestration code.

**Configuration should be visual.** GUI interfaces enable faster iteration and broader accessibility compared to YAML editing in terminals.

**AI should generate infrastructure.** LLMs understand and generate service specifications more easily than traditional code, enabling AI-native development workflows.

**Debugging should be transparent.** All service behavior, state transitions, and inter-service communication should be inspectable and modifiable in real-time.

**Users should own their stack.** Services run locally under user control without dependencies on cloud providers or platform vendors.
