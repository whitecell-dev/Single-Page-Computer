# MicroService OS — AI-Native Computing Environment

**A terminal with a GUI, where bash scripts are JSON/YAML.**

MicroService OS transforms the command-line paradigm for the AI era. Each service runs in isolation with declarative configuration, visual interfaces, and zero infrastructure dependencies. Build, deploy, and orchestrate microservices directly in your browser.

```
Traditional Terminal:        MicroService OS:
┌─────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────┐
│ bash/zsh shell  │          │ Service Runtime │
│ .sh scripts     │    →     │ JSON/YAML specs │
│ CLI tools       │          │ Visual Interface│
│ Text output     │          │ GUI Services    │
└─────────────────┘          └─────────────────┘
```

## Architecture: Services as First-Class Citizens

### Service Definition
Each service is a self-contained JSON specification:

```json
{
  "id": "api-monitor",
  "type": "spc",
  "title": "API Health Monitor",
  "spec": {
    "endpoints": [
      {"name": "auth", "url": "https://api.example.com/health"},
      {"name": "data", "url": "https://api.example.com/status"}
    ],
    "interval": 30000,
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "health_check",
        "if": "response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300",
        "then": {"status": "healthy", "color": "green"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Service Types

- **`monitor`** — Health checks, log tails, system status
- **`processor`** — Data transformations, calculators, parsers
- **`interface`** — Forms, dashboards, configuration panels
- **`connector`** — API clients, data fetchers, integrations
- **`agent`** — LLM-powered services that modify themselves

### Service Orchestration

Services communicate through shared state and event streams:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {"id": "data-fetch", "type": "connector", "outputs": ["user_data"]},
    {"id": "data-transform", "type": "processor", "inputs": ["user_data"]},
    {"id": "dashboard", "type": "interface", "displays": ["transformed_data"]}
  ]
}
```

## AI-Native Design

### Natural Language → Service Specs
```
"Monitor Bitcoin price and alert when it drops below $50k"
     ↓
{
  "type": "monitor",
  "spec": {
    "source": "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd",
    "condition": "data.bitcoin.usd < 50000",
    "action": "alert"
  }
}
```

### LLM Service Generation
- AI agents can create, modify, and deploy services
- Human-readable configurations enable AI understanding
- Self-documenting service specifications
- Collaborative human-AI development workflows

## Core Benefits

### Zero Infrastructure
- No containers, orchestrators, or service mesh required
- Runs entirely in browser with optional desktop runtime
- Services persist in localStorage or exportable files
- Instant deployment and scaling

### Visual Service Management
- Real-time service status and logs
- Interactive configuration editing
- Drag-and-drop service composition
- Visual dependency mapping

### Declarative Everything
- Services defined by specifications, not code
- Deterministic behavior from text-based rules
- Version control friendly (pure JSON/YAML)
- Easy testing and debugging

## Use Cases

### Development Operations
- API monitoring and health dashboards
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Configuration management interfaces
- Deployment pipeline visualization

### Business Automation
- Data processing workflows
- Compliance monitoring systems
- Customer dashboard generators
- Integration service management

### Personal Productivity
- Custom tool interfaces
- Data analysis pipelines
- Task automation services
- Information aggregation dashboards

## Service Ecosystem

### Built-in Service Types
```bash
# List available service types
services list-types

# Create new service from template
services create --type=monitor --name=api-health

# Deploy service to runtime
services deploy api-health.json

# View running services
services ps
```

### Service Registry
- Shareable service definitions
- Community-contributed templates
- Version management and updates
- Dependency resolution

## Comparison to Traditional Architectures

| Traditional Microservices | MicroService OS |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Docker containers | JSON service specs |
| Kubernetes orchestration | Browser runtime |
| Service mesh networking | Shared state communication |
| YAML deployment configs | Visual service editor |
| CI/CD pipelines | Instant deployment |
| Infrastructure teams | Individual developers |

## Technical Architecture

### Service Runtime
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Resource monitoring and limits
- Inter-service communication bus
- State persistence layer

### Configuration Engine
- JSON Schema validation
- Template expansion and variables
- Environment-specific overrides
- Hot reloading capabilities

### Visual Interface
- Service topology visualization
- Real-time metrics and logging
- Interactive debugging tools
- Configuration form generation

## Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Define service specification
echo '{"type": "processor", "spec": {...}}' > my-service.json

# 2. Test locally
services run my-service.json

# 3. Deploy to runtime
services deploy my-service.json

# 4. Monitor and iterate
services logs my-service
services edit my-service
```

## Roadmap

### Core Platform
- Service dependency resolution
- Advanced inter-service communication
- Plugin architecture for custom service types
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### AI Integration
- Natural language service generation
- Automated service optimization
- Intelligent error handling and recovery
- Self-healing service networks

### Enterprise Features
- Multi-tenant service isolation
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging and compliance
- Enterprise service registry

## Philosophy

### Services Should Be Declarative
Complex distributed systems emerge from simple, composable service definitions rather than imperative orchestration code.

### Configuration Should Be Visual
GUI interfaces enable faster iteration and broader accessibility compared to YAML editing in terminals.

### AI Should Generate Infrastructure
LLMs can understand and generate service specifications more easily than traditional code, enabling AI-native development workflows.

### Users Should Own Their Stack
Services run locally under user control without dependencies on cloud providers or platform vendors.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Download the runtime
curl -O https://microservice.os/runtime.html

# Open in browser
open runtime.html

# Create your first service
```

MicroService OS represents a fundamental shift from infrastructure-heavy distributed systems to lightweight, declarative, AI-composable service architectures.
